# Logic Signal Generator

8-channel 3.3V/5V 4MHz logic signal generator based on a PIC18F26K22.

## Features

* 8 independant channels that can also be used as a single 8-bit port.
* Microcontroller hardware I2C, UART, SPI and 3 PWM modules available on signal connector.
* USB-powered.
* Embedded 3.3V up to 1A power supply (3.3V is derived from USB power, so this power could be limited by your USB port).
* USB 5V power supply available on board.
* On-board switch to select logic signals output voltage (3.3V or 5V).
* On-board FTDI USB FIFO connected to microcontroller to display debug data as fast as possible. This shows as a standard serial port on your development computer.
* Doubled signals connector to easily connect a logic analyzer.
* Dedicated ground connector to have as many ground signals as logic signals.
* PICkit-compatible standard connector to easily program on-board microcontroller with your favorite development tool.
* Microchip XC8-compatible template source code with FTDI FIFO support library.
* Compact and robust casing designed to bring the signal generator on field.
* Easy to build at home (even casing).
